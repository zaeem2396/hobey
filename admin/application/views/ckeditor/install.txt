[b]Attention[/b] This plugin is not ready to use, you have to expand your filebrowser.

This plugin adds two new tabs to the flash dialog. One for FLV if you load a *.flv and one for MP3 if you load a *.mp3 file from your filebrowser. That the plugin works your filebrowser has to set "playerpath/player/flvplayer.swf?flv=/path/to/your/file/movie.flv" for FLVs or "playerpath/player/mp3player.swf?mp3=/path/to/your/file/music.mp3" for MP3s to dialogs URL field.

To test the plugin you can load a FLV file to flash dialog and copy "playerpath/player/flvplayer.swf?flv=" before the URL.

[b]Known bug:[/b] You can not use the fullscreen feature of FLV-player. That's a bug of CKEditor. It is not possible to set allowFullScreen to true for swf files.

The plugin uses the players from neolao: [url=http://www.flv-player.net/]flv-player.net[/url] [url=http://www.flash-mp3-player.net/]flash-mp3-player.net[/url]
